			What a cooooool App! Here I can set up my alarm and play wonderful games as well. 
When the alarm rings ,I used to turn it off and continue sleeping. I set up my alarm at 7 
 but when I got up, it was already 7:50 or so. I hate this kind of lazy life style. However, 
after downloading this app, I “have to” jump out of my bed and walk for several steps the 
 minute the alarm rings. Now I have more flexible time and I feel energetic the WHOLE
 day.

			As a high school student, I have to get up early on weekdays, but on 
weekends, I have no motivation to do so. Every Saturday I just turn off
my alarm again and again, saying: Five more minutes. I personally hope
to get up earlier on weekends so that I can finish my homework on time
and even do something else. Actually I thought Life Alarm is just a normal
wake-up app the first time I heard it. However, I totally fall in love with
this app as I am able to get up much earlier on weekends with its help. 
I have to say that the designers are so creativeｆand LIFE ALARM is really 
worth recommendation.
